# clock50
I have trouble finding a good clock to have on my side monitor while i work. They are either just black and white, or I'm just not a fan of the font or design. I intend to create a customisable clock app.
(the name is clock50 as this is my final project for Harvard's cs50x)

I used PyCharm (coding software) to write this code, and have pasted the final result here. I preferred their layout and execution of html pages to GitHub Codespace. 

The font is minimal, and the background and clock colours can be changed. The background has a customisable gradient.



(longer readme file was uploaded to cs50x)
